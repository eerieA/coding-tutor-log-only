# Project: Coding? Explain Yourself!

The application facilitates code comprehension assessment for students and progress tracking for teachers. Students will describe given functions in plain English, and Ollama, an open-source LLM, generates code matching their descriptions. The generated code is tested against predefined functions to evaluate comprehension. Key features include user authentication, student and teacher accounts, and a backend comprising an API for data interaction, a code validator for testing generated code, a database for storing user data and submissions, and integration with the Ollama model for code generation.

*Note: This app description was copied from our internal repo's README.md. Said repo was downloaded from UBC GitHub space and then uploaded to a repo under my GitHub account on this site, but is kept private. The reason being I am not sure if we have full rights to the course project product itself yet.*

## Revised demo video 4 months later

This was done 4 months later. After adding a chat box feature, I did a concise retro showcasing all the main features the team completed. This is a more polished video trying to include everyone's contributions.

## Personal contribution highlights

I contributed various features big and small, and made a video demoing 3 biggest ones.

This was done right after the official completion date, so it was not a very polished video.

Other contributions:
- Mocha tests (both for Node environment and browser environment).
- Async back-end function debugging and fixes.
- Simple user jailbreak attempt prevention.
- Other bug fixes and integration tests.

But those are too fragmented and a bit overwhelming to show in the video.

## Tech Stack:

- React
- Vite
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Nodemon
- Ollama (llama3)
- Mocha
